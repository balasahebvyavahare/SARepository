/*
 * Scala has both functions and methods and we use the terms method and function interchangeably with a minor difference.
 *  A Scala method is a part of a class which has a name, 
 *  a signature, optionally some annotations, 
 *  and some bytecode where as a function in Scala is a complete object which can be assigned to a variable. In other words,
 *   a function, which is defined as a member of some object, is called a method.
